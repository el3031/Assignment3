# Assignment3

An assignment with two parts.
Part 1: build a VR application for Oculus Quest that allows the user to build a maze. After the maze is built, export this file in a csv format
Part 2: build an AR phone-based app that reads in the csv file from part 1 and builds the same maze. Then allow the user to traverse the maze.
